Having never done any kind of coding before, starting out is pretty confusing, but not as bad as I thought it was going to be.  Thankfully, I'm tech savvy and know my way around electronic devices and using the internet.  So with a few free coding sources/courses to take, I figured that I'd tackle The Odin Project 1st, as I seemed to just "get it" and how their curriculum is laid out is easy for me to follow.  With that came the 1st project assignment of making a webpage with 3 recipes with photos.   Today, I can FINALLY say that I have finished the 1st project , which took me about 2 weeks to figure out the minor typos that were causing the photos to not show up and lists of ingredients to post all in one line, instead of in a formal list.  Here's the final draft to this recipe project.
