These hard shell chocolate candies add a little bit of crunch while still keeping that signature “melt in your mouth” you know and love.">

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <P>M&M Brownies are perfect birthday party treats, weeknight desserts, or lunchbox snacks.  This recipe uses cocoa powder instead of melted chocolate which makes it so much easier with all the same fudgy rich chocolate goodness. These brownies are great especially if you have kids who love to bake! It’s an easy recipe that kids can make.  </P>
